# Different ClusteringAlgorithms on Different datasets

Different clustering algorthms like K-means, Hierarchical clustering(Agglomerative clustering), GMM(Gaussian Mixture models) clustering, BIRCH clustering and spectral clustering are performed on three different datasets(Iris, Breast Cancer dataset, Wine dataset).

Clustering is performed on original data and also on data after reducing their dimensions to 2 using PCA(Principal component analysis). NMI(Normalized mutual info score) of different clustering algorithms on both the original data and 2-D data is analysed.
